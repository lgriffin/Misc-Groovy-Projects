During my PhD I worked with Groovy for a period of time within the context of XMPP.
A simulation involving group IDs within XMPP was carried out using Groovy
and is included here. Some work on Grails will be uploaded over time.


- GID: A Group ID simulation to investiagate the behavior of the XMPP roster
during load, including multiple XMPP rosters signed into the one client.
